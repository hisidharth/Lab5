To start this solution I used the rules of a bst.
The rule I used was that when printed to a list in an inorder traversal, the values of a bst
should be ascending.

This was an easy way to check if a bst was valid or not so first I added each element using inorder traversal
to an arrayList.

After I had the arrayList returned, I checked if the i'th element of the arrayList was greater than the i+1'th 
element of the arrayList thus verifying if the arrayList was in ascending order or not.
